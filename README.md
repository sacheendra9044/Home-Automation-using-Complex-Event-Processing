# Home-Automation-using-Complex-Event-Processing

There has been a great advancement in Internet of Things over the past few
years. This has all been extremely useful in meeting the needs of people,
providing easy access to scalable servers, and clouds of service anywhere
anytime. This advancement has led to the rise in the domain of Automated Home
Systems or rather in other words – SMART HOMES.
A Smart Home is an integrated home system with smart technologies installed,
which allows people within to control the various electronic devices at home via a
single tap of a button, through a single command, or through a single click. This
Smart Home development uses different kinds of sensors. It makes use of data
collected and provided by various sources which is further analysed to take the
desired action. The management of this large amount of data is a herculean
challenge for Smart Homes or rather we can say this is a COMPLEX TASK.
Therefore, to handle this Complex task, a technology that can efficiently process
the data and give timely response is required named as CEP – Complex Event
Processing. It can manage events flexibly and efficiently. The way it can correlate
the data received through various resources or various events in IOT, Home
Automation becomes even SMARTER.

In this project, our aim is to explore and use this technology to the fullest for
Home Automation. CEP is made to use. It receives various events from multiple
sources, and can be used to give immediate responses to the events detected in
Smart Homes.

The results expected are to have gotten immediate response whenever required
from CEP as it extracts useful information from continuously running incoming
streams of data.

Based on expected outcomes of this project, we can gauge the potential of CEP in
handling such complex events even more efficiently. We can not only use it to
build a smart home but rather a smart residential service system or SMART
APARTMENTS/COLONIES at the larger scale. The scope or domain of CEP with
respect to Home Automation is not limited at all, and it needs to be unravelled to
the fullest.
